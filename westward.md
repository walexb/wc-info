# Introduction

These are non-official notes and links to the strips of
[Westward](http://www.westwardcomic.com/), the wonderful science-fiction
web comic by [Elliot Toman](https://www.patreon.com/elliottoman).

# Realities that appear most often

Because of an experiment that began billions of years ago, Earth exists
in multiple realities (while Mars has only one reality) up to June 2000,
and there are are some common elements and people among them. In
particular _Francis Carter_, _Alice Donovan_, _Rex Donovan_ exist in
both main realities.

## _Purgatory_: in this reality nothing is knowns of Mars and Escherspace.

### History

Similar to ours, except that the alien ship arrives, like in all of
Earth's realities, in 2000-06. When it arrives in the solar system
the government keeps it a secret.

### Francis, Alice, Rex

In this reality Francis is a science professor who marries his
gifted student Mary O'Neil and fathers Alice and Rex, and then
becomes an outcast science crank. Alice ends up living in Purgatory
(Utah) with stepfather Jeremy Donovan, after leaving Arizona with
her mother Mary, who dies on arriving in Purgatory. Rex is abandoned
and eventually finds their father Francis again.

## _Epiphany_: in this reality Viktor destroys Europe on Epiphany 1949.

### History

Hitler assassinated, the Nazis conquer Europe, including Switzerland,
Viktor creates a new race, has a working fusion reactor, and uses it
to enter Escherspace just above Berlin on Epiphany 1949, turning
Europe and most of the world into a horror, and colonizing planets
in the past with a cyborg super-race. Viktor's son Abraham instead
escapes from Europe, changes surname to Schultz, founds United Space
Group. The world divides into communists and west (USA, Brazil,
Europe), with war in Asia. USG under CEO Frederick starts to clean
up the Epiphany damage, sends Francis to Mars in 1974 and again in
1984, he finds the ancient martian machines, eventually Phobos helps
build "Westward", which eventually provides the power to get the
alien ship to continue trip to Earth. "Westward" then visits two
planets who have both been colonized by Viktor and cyborg super-race
in the past, and gets back to Earth to see the arrival of the alien
ship.

### Francis, Alice, Rex

In this reality Francis is an astronaut who travels to mars in 1974,
then the captain of "Westward", and eventualy marries Rosemary Wells.
Alice lives under Mars with stepfather Robert, and Rex is a Westward
crew member who dies on planet Epiphany, but nobody on Mars except
for Alice remembers him. It is not clear who is the father of Alice
and Rex, but certainly not Robert Donovan.

## _merged_: when the alien ship arrives all Earth realities merge.

### History

USG evacuates Earth, occupies top levels of underground Mars, sends
dozens of colonist ships out in random directions into the past.
The Scientific Society also has been evacuated to Mars, and Lamont
preaches to undermine it. "Westward" is cut down to half size, and
departs again to follow the colonist ships.

### Francis, Alice, Rex

"Epiphany" Francis is still captain of "Westward" that is following
the colonist ships. Alice exists in two copies, on Earth, fighting
the ghosts, and on Mars, where she first travels back in time 4
billion years and then travels with martians to 4 billion years ago
Earth, where she finds the already ancient machines, and "freezes"
in time, and then reappears on Mars and ends up on "Westward". Rex
on Earth status unclear, Rex on Mars still a ghost.
